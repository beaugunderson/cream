This would be a browser extension that shows CrunchBase data for the
currently-viewed site. Unfinished, because I ran out of steam & time
in the morning - trendy fast CSV parsers totally fail CSP, so I drained
time trying binary-csv, csv-parser, and dsv there. And Chrome Extension
development is less than enjoyable.
